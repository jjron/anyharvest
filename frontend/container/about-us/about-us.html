    <p class="col-md-8 pull-right"> Armed with a computer engineering degree and a belief in the power of innovation, this software developer wants to help people improve their organization's capabilities and make a positive impact in their own communities. Regardless of age, socioeconomic limitations, handicaps, or any walls we make for ourselves, I believe that software development allows us to transcend barriers and ignite in ourselves a life-long passion for creativity and learning. When I'm not programming the real-life Jarvis, I'll be playing music or watching my Zags play.</p>

    <p class="col-md-8 pull-right">Spending time building jet engines in the Air Force and after college selling logistics and software technologies in the private sector, I found myself on the opposite side of where I wanted to be in those technologies and continuous improvement models. I believe we have yet to reach the peak of human performance mental or physical and know I can fuel that passion through software development. My success has been particularly driven by the strong relationships built with team members, upper management, partner organizations and the community which results in win-win situations and a foundation for future success.</p>

    <p class="col-md-8 pull-right">I enjoy spending as much time as possible snowboarding when it is possible, with that being said I used that and other factors to motivate me to move to Seattle. Having left a great career in logistics behind I took my time to look at other careers that interested me. I have always been an early adapter of technology and am passionate about getting that technology into the community to help everyone. So I became a developer to be able to make my passions into a reality. </p>
